# Backend Skills and Knowledge

Since the release of JDK 1.4, it has been 20 years. Due to its cross-platform feature, Java has become an unshakeable backbone in the field of backend development, ranking among the top three programming languages on TIOBE for many years. Meanwhile, the updates in its technological knowledge system have been revolutionary, evolving from bulky EJB and heavyweight application services to the SSH-based web application with Tomcat, and now to the Spring suite coupled with containers. Backend developers are required to learn increasingly diverse knowledge, which has far exceeded the scope of the language itself.

Currently, there is no absolute standard in the industry for what constitutes a qualified backend developer, but there is a certain level of consensus within the industry on the knowledge and technology system that needs to be mastered.

This chapter aims to archive the main technological knowledge systems currently prevalent in the industry, serving as a reference for subsequent talent cultivation.

The content will cover: data structures, algorithms, Java fundamentals, JVM, the Spring suite (including Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud), infrastructure (such as RDBMS, NoSQL databases, message brokers, application servers, and file services), Docker, k8s, DevOps, distributed systems, operating systems, networks, development tools, system architecture, design patterns, and other languages (like Golang).

自JDK1.4发布，据今已有20个年头，Java语言由于其跨平台特性，成为了当今后端领域无可撼动的中坚力量，常年排名TIOBE编程语言前三。同时，随之而来的技术知识体系更新也是翻天覆地，从笨重的EJB+重量级应用服务，到SSH组合+Tomcat，再到现在的Spring全家桶 + 容器。后端程序员被要求学习越来越庞杂的知识，内容范围已经远远超出了语言本身。

如何成为一个合格的后端开发，业界当前没有绝对标准，但需掌握的知识技术体系在行业内已有一定的认知。

本章节将尝试将目前业界主要的技术知识体系归档，以供后续的人才培养。

内容将包括：
数据结构，算法，Java 基础, JVM, Spring全家桶（Spring Framework, Spring Boot，Spring Cloud）, 基础设施(RDBMS, NoSQL数据库，Message Broker，应用服务器，文件服务）, Docker, k8s, DevOps, 分布式, 操作系统, 网络，开发工具, 系统架构，设计模式，其他语言(Golang）
